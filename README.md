Run the index.html directly in your browser.

The web page will show a chart bar with the tags, bars, category axis, value axis and gridlines. The size of bar chart will be adjusted with the large of viewport.

When click on a specific bar, a label with detail score, aggragated score and player's name will show at the top of the bar. In the same time, the anchor id in url will also be changed. Click on a not-bar area, the label will disappear. 

The page allows access with the anchor id in url. But for the moment, the verification of valid id is not done. Please enter the url with anchor like the following format: (#playerIndex_date)
